        Listed below are your sets and loose bricks.
        To add or delete your entire sets or bricks, insert a value and hit the button.
        You can't delete a single brick from an entire set.
        However, you can convert your set to loose bricks and then delete those.
        Note that this cannot be undone.
        Warning: you can have only 100 sets and 10.000 bricks of a type.
        If you exceed that limit (e.g. by converting a set), your set or brick quantity
        will
        be capped to these limits.
